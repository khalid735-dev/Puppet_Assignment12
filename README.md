**Project Summary: Puppet Configuration Management**

**Objective:**
- Implement a configuration management solution using Puppet.
- Automate the configuration of system settings, applications, and infrastructure across multiple machines.
- Ensure consistency, repeatability, and scalability of system configurations.

**Project Plan:**
- **Phase 1: Setup & Environment Configuration**
  - Install Puppet master and agent nodes.
  - Configure Puppet server and agents on virtual machines.
  - Test basic connectivity and agent communication.

- **Phase 2: Define Puppet Manifests & Modules**
  - Develop Puppet manifests for system configuration (e.g., user management, package installation, service configuration).
  - Create reusable Puppet modules for common configurations.
  - Apply best practices for modularity and scalability.

- **Phase 3: Testing & Validation**
  - Implement automated testing for manifests using Puppet testing tools.
  - Validate configurations on multiple environments (e.g., staging and production).
  - Resolve issues and optimize manifest code.

- **Phase 4: Deployment & Documentation**
  - Deploy Puppet configuration on production systems.
  - Document Puppet manifest structure, modules, and deployment process.
  - Provide training and support for future maintenance.
